CpuCacheMountainViewer
======================

This is the result of the mountain program from "Computer Systems: A Programmer's perspective" by Randal E.Bryant and David R.O'Hallaron.

I ran those on a MacPro 5,1 and a MacBookAir 4,2.

I also attached the Excel graph generated.

Please run `make ARCH=<alpha,x86,riscv>` to compile this program.
